Women with low ovarian reserve or low egg count face unique challenges during IVF. The ovarian reserve declines naturally with age, but other factors such as genetics, medical history, and lifestyle can contribute. To improve IVF success, fertility specialists first conduct comprehensive tests, including hormone profiling, antral follicle count, and AMH levels. Personalized stimulation protocols are designed to maximize egg retrieval, often using higher doses of gonadotropins under close monitoring. Adjunct therapies such as coenzyme Q10, DHEA supplementation, and lifestyle modifications—including a balanced diet, exercise, stress management, and avoiding smoking or alcohol—may help enhance egg quality. In some cases, using donor eggs can offer a higher chance of successful pregnancy, especially if age or ovarian reserve significantly limits options. Timing is crucial, as repeated IVF cycles may be recommended to accumulate viable embryos. Clinics often employ advanced lab techniques such as ICSI to fertilize retrieved eggs effectively. Emotional support and counseling are also vital because low egg count treatments can be physically and emotionally demanding. Open communication with the fertility team ensures adjustments are made based on individual response and progress. Success rates vary depending on age, egg quality, and overall health, but with a tailored approach, women with low egg count can achieve successful IVF outcomes.
